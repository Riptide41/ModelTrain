# Project description
This project should be used in conjunction with the [Cable_Defect_Detection](https://github.com/Riptide41/Cable_Defect_Detection) project, and is mainly used to train the original cable detection model used in the [Cable_Defect_Detection](https://github.com/Riptide41/Cable_Defect_Detection) project.
The project is based on the YOLOv5 object detection network, which integrates the steps required to train a object detection model, including three parts: data set labeling, data set sorting, and model training. In addition, the training parameters can be adjusted according to the actual situation to obtain a better detection model.

# Quick Start
The environment that the program depends on is similar to [Cable_Defect_Detection](https://github.com/Riptide41/Cable_Defect_Detection) project. When a python library is missing, you can use the "pip install XXX" command to install it.

After installation, run the main.py file under the project to display the main interface of the project, as shown in the figure.
